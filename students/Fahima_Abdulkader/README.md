*AIR POLLUTION DATA ANALYSIS â€“ KERALA*
Overview:-
This project analyzes city-level air pollution in Kerala using real-time data fetched from a government API. It was developed in Google Colab, making it easy to run in a browser with no local setup required.

Features:-
Retrieves real-time air quality data for Kerala from api.data.gov.in.
Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for effective analysis.
Identifies the most and least polluted cities in Kerala.
Determines the worst pollutant type by average value.
Simulates the effect of population migration (10% moving from dirtiest to cleanest city).
Visualizes pollution levels before and after migration using bar, line, and scatter plots.
Summarizes findings with practical insights for policy makers.

Technologies:-
Python 3 (tested in Google Colab)
pandas
matplotlib
requests

How to Use:-
Open in Colab:
Copy and paste the code into a new Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com), or upload the .ipynb file if supplied.

Run All Cells:-
Simply run all cells to download the latest pollution data, process it, and view results.

Review Visualizations:-
The final output will include bar, line, and scatter plots plus detailed printed findings.

Output:-
A summary of the most and least polluted cities and the worst pollutant
Charts showing city-level pollution before and after migration
Policy suggestions for improving air quality
